Silverstone has a couple of products that go in the same direction.

- Silverstone ES02-USB
- Silverstone ES02-PCIE
- Silverstone ES03-WiFi

The first 2 products work with a remote only.
No easy integration is possible with Home Assistant other than adding an RF transmitter to your setup.

The third one needs a third-party app.
So another app on your phone and an internet connection if I am not mistaken. Another cloud service probably will die in a few years and turn this device into e-waste afterward.
